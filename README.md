# Cryptocurrencies

## While this lesson taught nothing on the subject of Cryptocurrencies the point of the exercise was how to condense the information into something useful that can be evaluated from the aspect of investment.

##  The methodology was to seperate the desired data into catergories, created dataframes around those columns, use PCA to scale values using two different methods, StandScaler and MinMaxScaler, merge those dataframes, and lastly to plot the values so that management can make decision based on scaled data.
